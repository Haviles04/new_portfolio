        <p>I am Henry Aviles. I've been an Ironworker and a Welder for Ironworker Local 40 for the past 7 years. I have recently decided I would like to change my occupation
            to Web Development. Over the past months I have been teaching myself, HTML, CSS, JS, REACT, NODE, BOOTSTRAP, GIT, and anything else I think I may need to be a succesful developer.
